# Kinematic Analysis of Human Fingers
This project is for the robotics course. 
This project focuses on the kinematic analysis of human fingers, with the goal of accurately posing the fingers to reach specific target destinations or follow predetermined trajectories. The human hand consists of three main parts: the palm, wrist, and five distinct fingers. Each finger is composed of multiple joints and bones, primarily revolute joints that allow for bending and flexion motions.

The fingers have three main joints: the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. The thumb differs from the other fingers as it has two hinge joints and two degrees of freedom. The other fingers have three hinge joints and three degrees of freedom. The rotations of the joints occur around the z-axis, and the angles are measured counterclockwise.

The project explores two scenarios: unconstrained joint angles and constrained joint angles. In the unconstrained case, each joint angle can vary independently within specific ranges. The forward kinematics equations are derived to determine the position of the fingertip based on the joint angles. Additionally, the project investigates the configurations that place the fingertip on an obstacle in space and explores the reachable positions of the fingertip without considering the obstacle.
